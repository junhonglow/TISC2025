# TISC2025
My CTF Journey: 2025

This repository contains write-ups for my first attempt at a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition. After returning from work, I spent many late nights tackling the challenges, learning new tools, techniques, and ways of thinking along the way.

TISC 2025 contained a total of 12 challenges, of which I only managed to solve challenges up to Level 4, and Level 5 proved elusive and remains unsolved. Despite not completing all challenges, this experience marked the start of my journey into CTFs and security research. Each write-up documents my thought process, methodology, and findings.

I hope this collection shows my learning journey and can serve as a reference for others starting out in CTFs.
